            <p>The Annual conference, ICMRSF-2025 is a dynamic interdisciplinary event
                organized by the Board of Professional Activities, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi
                University (SMVDU) as a part of the University Annual Festival '25, Ekatva.
                This conference serves as a platform for scholars, researchers, students,
                and professionals from diverse disciplines, including sciences,
                engineering, literature, linguistics, business, economics, and more, to
                engage in meaningful discussions on the pressing need for sustainability
                in today’s world. The conference on “Multidisciplinary Research for
                Sustainable Future” reflects the critical relevance of sustainability in
                addressing the escalating challenges of environmental degradation,
                economic disparities, and social injustices. With the world grappling from
                the consequences of climate change, resource depletion, and unequal
                growth, the conference underscores the urgent need for sustainable
                practices that balance ecological health, social equity, and economic
                progress. By providing a forum for the exchange of ideas and
                dissemination of research, SMVDU aims to foster critical engagement
                and warmly invites all those committed to the vision of a sustainable
                future to contribute to this significant discourse through submissions of
                their research abstracts in this Two-day International Conference
                scheduled to be held from 28th February - 1st March, 2025.</p>

        <h2>Vasudha</h2>
        <p>As we stand on the cusp of an era filled with both opportunity and challenge,
            the pursuit of sustainable futures emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a
            critical path to address global issues such as climate change, resource
            depletion, and social inequality. It envisions a world where human progress
            aligns with the planet's ecological limits, ensuring prosperity for both current
            and future generations.
            The origins of sustainable development can be traced back to the 1987
            Brundtland Report, which emphasized the idea of "meeting the needs of the
            present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
            own needs." The subsequent introduction of the United Nations Sustainable
            Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 further cemented sustainability as a
            central focus of global governance and cooperation. These goals address a
            wide range of issues, from eradicating poverty and hunger to promoting
            clean energy, good health, and education. Amidst these pressing challenges,
            India demonstrates its commitment to sustainability through initiatives such
            as the National Action Plan on Climate Change and a robust emphasis on
            renewable energy, with a goal of achieving 500 GW of renewable capacity by
            2030. The country is actively engaged in advancing the UN's Sustainable
            Development Goals, striving to harmonize economic growth with
            environmental conservation, thereby reflecting a comprehensive strategy to
            combat climate change while promoting social and economic progress for
            its citizens. The past few decades have underscored the urgency of adopting
            sustainable practices, prompting a re-evaluation of traditional development
            models. As such, the call for sustainable futures is not merely a theoretical
            ideal, but a practical necessity for ensuring both human survival and equity.
            Henceforth, embracing sustainability is a pivotal step toward navigating the
            complexities of an era defined by innovation and interconnectedness.</p>
